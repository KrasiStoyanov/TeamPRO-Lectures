###Task 2:
#####Create a HTML page containing the folowing:
* Div with id `main-content`, containing:
	* Div with id `gallery`
		* Divs with classes `image-wrapper` (how many times you want); each `image-wrapper` contains:
			* Image with class `image` (whatever image you want)
* Add a style tag in the head tag and write the following `css`:
	```
	* {
		margin: 0;
		padding: 0;
	}
	```
	* This clears all default styles set by the browser (I prefer you use it)
	* Make the main div element:
		* with `90%` width 
		* to be centered with margin
		* `#f1f1f1` color for background
	* Make the div with class `image-wrapper`:
		* with `200px` width
		* make all of these divs on one line `(use displays)`
		* add some `paddings` and `margins`
		* play with the borders
	* Make the images with class `image`:
		* with width `100%`
		* play with the borders

* Result should look like: <a href="https://github.com/KrasiStoyanov/TeamPRO-Lectures/blob/master/WebLectures/Homeworks/01.HTML%26CSSBasics/02.CSSDimensions.png">Result image</a>
