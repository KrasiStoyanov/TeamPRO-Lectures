#Tasks
###Task 1:
#####Create a HTML page containing the folowing:
* Header section, containing the following:
	* Nav bar with div with class `nav`, containing:
		* Unordered list with sample links
* Div with id `main content`, containing the following:
	* Div with id `artists`, containing:
		* Bootstrap-looking grid system with sample content
		* Example:
		```
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-3">
				...
			</div>
		</div>
		```
* Add a `link` in the head section to connect to your css and style the page:
	* Clear all default styles set by the browser
	* Add custom font; Use this for reference - [Custom font usage in css](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_font-face_rule.asp)
		* To use custom font just simply go to this [website](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/) download a sample font or convert your font file (file with extension .ttf or .otf)
		* You can locate your fonts in the directory in your PC as follows: `Control Panel\Appearance and Personalization\Fonts`
	* Style the navigation bar using whatever colors, links and fonts you like
	* Style the custom grid system making every `.col-3` with `20%` width
	* Style the artist' data and add some `box-shadow` to it; If you want, use this [tool](http://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow)
* Result should look like: [Result image](01.StyleWithCSS.png)

<!-- ###Task 2:
#####Create a HTML page containing the folowing:
* Div with id `main-content`, containing:
	* Div with id `gallery`
		* Divs with classes `image-wrapper` (how many times you want); each `image-wrapper` contains:
			* Image with class `image` (whatever image you want)
* Add a style tag in the head tag and write the following `css`:
	```
	* {
		margin: 0;
		padding: 0;
	}
	```
	* This clears all default styles set by the browser (I prefer you use it)
	* Make the main div element:
		* with `90%` width 
		* to be centered with margin
		* `#f1f1f1` color for background
	* Make the div with class `image-wrapper`:
		* with `200px` width
		* make all of these divs on one line `(use displays)`
		* add some `paddings` and `margins`
		* play with the borders
	* Make the images with class `image`:
		* with width `100%`
		* play with the borders

* Result should look like: <a href="https://github.com/KrasiStoyanov/TeamPRO-Lectures/blob/master/WebLectures/Homeworks/01.HTML%26CSSBasics/02.CSSDimensions.png">Result image</a>

	* Make the image with class `image-top-middle` go top middle
	* Make the image with class `image-top-right` go in the top right corner
	* Make the image with class `image-right-middle` go right middle
	* Make the image with class `image-bottom-right` go in the bottom right corner
	* Make the image with class `image-bottom-middle` go bottom middle
	* Make the image with class `image-bottom-left` go in the bottom left corner
